# Restart Velora Go

When the user says **"restart velora go"** (or similar: "restart velora", "restart velora go"):

1. Run the restart script from the **project root** in a **background** terminal:
   - Command: `./restart-velora-go.sh`
   - Use a terminal with the project root as the working directory.
   - The script stops Flask (5001), frontend (5173), and the Celery worker, then runs the same start script as "start velora go". Redis is left running.

2. Tell the user that Velora is restarting and where to open the app (e.g. frontend at http://localhost:5173, API at http://localhost:5001).

Do not run the script in the foreground in a way that blocks the user; use background execution or instruct them to run it in a separate terminal.
